# The-Silent-Game
I am sorry that I couldnt think of a more intuatice less ironic name But this will just be for development the name of the game can be decided on latter. This Game will be made with Unity in C++. This will be organized so that there is a  test branch and a graphics/sound branch. in the  test branch everything should be uploaded into the correct folder e.g. code in Code, level data in Levels then into a folder with the date of the upload and then into you`er name In the graphics/sound branch everything is to be organized such that its the same as the testing and folder also it is were all approved art and sound should be kept. Any art/sound that most of us agree should be in the game can be moved from testing/ideas to the graphics/sound folder. but can also be removed from there latter.

Recomended reading for anyone doing any kind of work on this ordered from most importent to least.
