# The-Silent-Game
I am sorry that I couldnt think of a more intuatice less ironic name But this will just be for development the name of the game can be decided on latter. This Game will be made with Unity in C++. This will be organized so that there is a  test branch and a graphics/sound branch. in the  test branch everything should be uploaded into the correct folder e.g. code in Code, level data in Levels then into a folder with the date of the upload and then into you`er name In the graphics/sound branch everything is to be organized such that its the same as the testing and folder also it is were all approved art and sound should be kept. Any art/sound that most of us agree should be in the game can be moved from testing/ideas to the graphics/sound folder. but can also be removed from there latter. For now the only rule is dont mess with the work of others unless you talk to them and they say its ok. If you do destroy all/most/alot of work done by anyone else you will be kicked of the team and all access to this projects cut off that is why whe upload into dated folders so that it would be hard to destroy anything to the point of unrecoverability.

The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles


Tools I use and recomend

Gimp: Without question the best free/open sourceImage editing program and in my opinion it is just as good as photoshop. So I highly sugest it to everyone working on art. 

Audacity: This would be horrible for music but for soundFX like walking and enviermental sounds and for diologe it is better than any other free program I have found so much so that i have never used a Paid program for its purposes. For the real music I will make the small amount for the first public version of the game.

Sublime Text: I Use this for everything (except for a very few rare when I need MS Word) from codeing to data stream editing to xml files so basiclly everythimg short of "official buissines" documents. There are some speacilized development IDE`s that I use but as far as versitility this can do anything. There is a free version  and it is still great but the best free program that I used for many years is notepad++.
